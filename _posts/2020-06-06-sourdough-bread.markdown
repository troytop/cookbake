# Sourdough

## Starter

* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 cup water

Feed every day for a week. 
Refrigerate when not actively feeding. 

## Dough

* 1/2 cup starter
* 1 1/3 cups + 2 tbsp lukewarm water (345ml)
* 4 cups flour (at least 2 cups white flour)
* 2 tsp salt

Mix starter and water together in a measuring cup until it forms a smooth
gruel. Optionally mix in 1/2 cup of flour to the measuring cup and let sit for
10 minutes until the mixture starts to bubble slightly. 

Mix the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl. This recipe can be used to
make white, whole wheat, or rye breads by varying the proportions:

* White: 4 cups white / all-purpose flour
* Whole Wheat: 2 cups white, 2 cups whole wheat flour
* Rye: 3 cups white, 1 cup rye flour
* Whole Wheat Rye: 2 cups white, 1 cup rye, 1 cup whole wheat flour

Add the starter/water mixture to the remaining flour in the mixing bowl, cover,
rest 30 minutes, stretch dough, rest 30 minutes. Repeat stretching and resting
three times then shape into a ball.

## Bulk rise

Cover with a damp tea towel or mixing bowl cover and leave for 8 to
12 hours.

## Shape 

Punch down risen loaf and reshape into a loaf. Pull the edges into the
centre and turn until you have a tight ball. Place the ball in a casserole pot
with a lid. Allow loaf to rise an additional 30 minutes. 

## Bake

Preheat oven to 465 F. Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife. Cover. Put
casserole pot in oven and reduce temperature to 450 F. 

Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on. Remove lid and bake for a further 10
minutes. Flip loaf out of the pot onto the oven rack, reduce heat to 350 F (on
Convect), and bake 10 more minutes.
