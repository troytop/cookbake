Dough 1/2 cup starter 1 1/3 cups + 2 tbsp lukewarm water (345ml) 4 cups flour (at least 2 cups white flour) 2 tsp salt Mix starter and water together in a measuring cup until it forms a smooth gruel. Optionally mix in 1/2 cup of flour to the measuring cup and let sit for 10 minutes until the mixture starts to bubble slightly. Mix the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl.
